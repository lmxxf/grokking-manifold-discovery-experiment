## Description
Grokking—the phenomenon where neural networks suddenly generalize after prolonged overfitting—has accumulated multiple theoretical explanations since its discovery in 2022: Goldilocks Zone, Softmax Collapse, Lazy-Rich transition, etc. This paper reviews these theories and identifies their common blind spot: most are word games; only Goldilocks Zone offers genuine insight. We propose a unified framework—the Manifold Discovery Hypothesis: memorization is a high-dimensional jagged curve passing through all training points, generalization is discovering the low-dimensional manifold on which data is distributed, and Grokking is the phase transition from the former to the latter. In one sentence: high-dimensional curve → low-dimensional surface.
